# RBXWhitelistExample
A short example for roblox whitelists using synapse's hashing function and githubs ability to provide data without html content

Requires Synapse X 

This was made to be an example to somebody showing how hashing is more secure than encryption, due to the fact that if someone manages to obtain the encryption key from deobfuscating the script, its a gone deal with the script, whereas if somebody deobfuscated a script which relies on hashing, they have nothing to decrypt, as everything is hashed and stored hashed, and values are compared by hashing and comparing to the table retrieved on the cloud

tl:dr 
example of hashing securely. made in 5 minutes.
